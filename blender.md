# Working in Blender

The simulation buildings/scenery was created in blender using BlenderGIS and then rendered and exported to be used in the simulation. Instructions on how to use BlenderGIS can be found below.

1. [Install BlenderGIS](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/wiki/Install-and-usage)
2. [Follow the BlenderGIS quick start guide](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/wiki/Quick-start)

And m1 mac users, like myself, will need to apply [this](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/issues/655#issuecomment-1197557235) workaround for BlenderGIS (its only two lines in the terminal)

To import the University of Minnesota campus into blender, just follow these videos pretty much exactly: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNtKnmRXVlo) and [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6ypxnYtl0g). And then use [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0lTz25xcx0) video to export your .obj and diffused texture map
